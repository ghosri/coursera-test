<h1>What is Nuclear Fission?</h1>
<p>Nuclear fission is a process in which a heavy nucleus, like uranium-235, is split into two smaller nuclei. This process releases a large amount of energy, as well as neutrons. The neutrons can then go on to split other uranium-235 nuclei, creating a chain reaction. This chain reaction can be used to generate electricity in nuclear power plants, or to create nuclear weapons.</p>
